# ITGM 220 - Core Principles: Programming

This course provided by the [Savannah College of Art and Design](https://www.scad.edu/) is designed to allow students develop the core principles of programming interactivity through object-oriented programming techniques using visual scripting tools and hand-coded scripting languages. Experiential learning enables students to develop applications and projects that include complex interactive websites, experimental interactive work and online games.

## Language
All codes in this course are programmed with Processing 3.
All codes except [Assignment 2](https://github.com/mataleogml/SCAD-ITGM220/tree/main/Assignment%202%20-%20Complex%20Pattern) and [Assignment 3](https://github.com/mataleogml/SCAD-ITGM220/tree/main/Assignment%203%20-%20Interactive%20Time-based%20Platform) will also runs on [Processing 4](https://processing.org/download).

## Requirement
All code should run by default without extra congifuration.

[Assignment 5 - Custom Class](https://github.com/mataleogml/SCAD-ITGM220/tree/main/Assignment%205%20-%20Custom%20Classes) requires the [Processing Sound Library](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound), you can install the library via the Processing IDE itself under `Sketch > Import Library > Add Library` then install the Sound Library by the [Processing Foundation](https://github.com/processing).
